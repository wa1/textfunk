# Wordfunk 

Chrome extension that adds various word functions (hence the name), lookups etc. through the context menu. Simply select a word and right-click. Initially the extension was created to let users (myself) sound educated by giving a list of synonyms when right-clicking a word, just like good ol' MS Word.
